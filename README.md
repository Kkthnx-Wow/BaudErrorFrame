# BaudErrorFrame
Records errors as they occur, allowing you to access them when you want to. Also provides additional technical information to help with fixing errors. This meant to be used alongside KkthnxUI!

The errors will be shown inside right side of the minimap **IF** using KkthnxUI with it. The idea behind this is so they are not an eye candy and are not annoying you. Though enough to let you know so you can report issues!
